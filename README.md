### Hello there, I'm [Verdi Pratama!](https://id.linkedin.com/in/verdipratama) ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹
I am a full-stack programmer for mobile, web & client/server applications. Proficient in Android, PHP + MySQL, Microsoft .NET + MS SQL Server, C#, HTML + Javascript, Visual Basic, Java, and VBA (MS Office macros), I also write technical documentations and do some graphic design works, primarily UI designs and image editing.

Fluent in writing & speaking English, I frequently do translations between English and Bahasa Indonesia (100% manual, to achieve human-quality translation). I sometimes also write articles and reviews for blogs and forums.
